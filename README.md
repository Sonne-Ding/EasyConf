# EasyConf

A lightweight configuration management library inspired by Hydra. EasyConf focuses solely on configuration management functionality, excluding logging and other peripheral features.

## Features

- **YAML Configuration Loading**: Load configuration from YAML files with ease
- **Hierarchical Configuration Merging**: Support recursive configuration merging across directory structures
- **Command-Line Override**: Dynamically override configuration parameters via command-line arguments
- **Object Instantiation**: Convenient instantiation of target objects from configuration

## Core Capabilities

### Configuration Loading
Load YAML configuration files seamlessly into your application.

### Hierarchical Configuration Mheritance
Implement recursive configuration merging where subdirectories can inherit and override configurations from parent directories, enabling flexible configuration organization.

### Command-Line Integration
Override any configuration parameter through command-line arguments, providing runtime flexibility without modifying configuration files.

### Dynamic Object Instantiation
Instantiate target objects directly from configuration specifications, simplifying dependency injection and object creation workflows.
